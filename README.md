# Pro3x Business Dashboard

Archived legacy project, published solely as a code sample.  
Originally developed as a simple POS application for issuing legally compliant fiscal invoices (per local regulatory requirements), it provided essential features for small business operations, including:

- product and item management  
- customer records  
- support for multiple cash registers  
- multi-location setup  
- multiple user accounts with access control  
- shift-based sales tracking per user  
- basic business reporting

Building **Pro3x Business Dashboard** was a valuable leadership and learning experience — from understanding fiscal and regulatory constraints to working directly with the businesses that used the system in their daily operations, gathering feedback, and translating real-world requirements into a practical software solution.
